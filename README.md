# Routines for the MPIM Sea Ice Lab
This repository contains routines for several devices used in the sea ice laboratory of the Max-Planck-Insitute for Meteorology in Hamburg.
All the read-out routines return a  python object (mostly `pandas` or `xarray` ) which can be used for further processing.

---

## Usage

Most of the routines have a CLI and further information on their usage can be obtained by calling the python script with `--help`.
